# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Project Overview of the Loan Prediction Risk
Use machine learning for credit risk for loans.

## All the Results for multiple machine learning models

-  Native Random Oversampling

 

-  Smote Oversampling

 

-  Undersampling

 

- Combination Under-Over Sampling

 

-Balanced Random Forest Classifier

 

-Easy ensemble AdaBoost Classifier

 

## Summary
 - Did multiple test to see if any of the methods is better than the other and if you could work with one or more to help you get the full picture.
